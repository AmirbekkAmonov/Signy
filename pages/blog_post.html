						Luxury is something everyone deserves from time to time. Such an
						indulgence can make a vacation a truly rejuvenating experience.
						One of the best ways to get the luxury of the rich and famous to
						fit into your budget can be yours through yacht charter
						companies. These companies specialize in creating custom sailing
						vacations that redefine travel. <br /><br />
						Planning Your Luxury <br /><br />
						Trip With your budget in mind, it is easy to plan a chartered
						yacht vacation. Companies often have a fleet of sailing vessels
						that can accommodate parties of various sizes. You may want to
						make it a more intimate trip with only close family. There are
						charters that can be rented for as few as two people. These
						include either a sailboat or motorboat and can come with or
						without a crew and captain to sail the ship for you. If you
						choose not to hire a crew, you will have to show that you are
						knowledgeable of sailing and can handle the ship competently.
						<br /><br />
						The next part of planning is to determine your starting and
						ending ports. This could be a place close to home and sail in
						one area or start and finish at two different ports. Generally,
						starting and stopping in the same port will save you money and
						is usually more convenient. You can also fly to a destination
						far from home and then sail another exotic sea. There are luxury
						yacht charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and
						Mediterranean seas or around Alaska, the Panama Canal, or
						anyplace you can imagine. <br /><br />
						Determining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a
						chartered yachting trip. You can have as little or many crew
						members as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries
						out of navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a
						real vacation that rivals the finest hotel services. You can
						also choose to have a chef and service crew as part of your
						vacation package. <br /><br />

						Destinations & Ports of important Charter Companies One of the
						greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation
						is the choice. You will most likely have a rough itinerary and
						that can be affected by weather. However, you are flexible in
						deciding how long you want to stay in a particular port and if
						you want to add or subtract stops along the way.

						Your yacht is your hotel that travels with you. There is only
						one flight and one hotel to book! Then you take all of your
						luggage and unpack it just once to enjoy several days of new
						destinations.
						<br /><br />
						If you have never experienced cruising before, a chartered
						experience is a great way to get your feet wet. It is different
						from cruise lines with thousands of guests because the people on
						your ship will be your friends and family. The personal touches
						of a chartered trip will help you develop your love for the sea
						with all the best benefits of commercial cruises. <br /><br />
						If you like the idea of knowing what it is really like to sail,
						but don’t want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise
						that puts you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will
						direct you as to your “chores” for keeping the ship in top shape
						and on course.
